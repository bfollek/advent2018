Advent of Code 2018 in elixir

I'm doing this to learn elixir. 

I sometimes write multiple versions of a function, to play with different approaches. My preferred version, the one I'd use in production code, is the *_v1 version. It's the version I think is easiest to understand. In my dotage, simple maintenance seems more important than clever code golf solutions. Other versions appear in no particular order, as they occurred to me.
